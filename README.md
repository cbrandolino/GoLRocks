GoLRocks
========

An HTML5/coffeescript sequencer based on Calway's Game of Life.

## About

It's pretty much what it says on the box. Try it [here](http://cbrandolino.github.com/GoLRocks).

It's been made in a weekend, and the last things I added (init code, controls) are quite rushed. 

Feel free to send me a pull request!

## Wanna add some synts?

Because that will be awesome. The synths API is incredibly simple; check out `/coffee/synths.coffee` and get freaky!
